                 <p>Event Manager turned Web Developer</p>
                 <p class="about-bio">My journey started in community organizing and nonprofit work, where I spent a decade making a positive impact on various causes close to my heart.<br>
                    Driven by my enthusiasm for event management, I transitioned to the world of commercial real estate, where I thrived in amplifying events and engaging audiences. However, like many others, my career took an unexpected turn due to the pandemic, leading me to explore new opportunities.<br>
                    During this time of self-discovery, I discovered a hidden passion for technology and web development. With sheer determination, I embarked on a self-study journey to delve into the fascinating world of coding and web design.
                    
                    Now, as I pursue a career in web development, I am excited to blend my background in community empowerment and event management with my newfound tech skills. My goal is to create digital experiences that make a difference, empowering individuals and businesses alike.
                    
                    Join me on this exciting path of innovation and growth as I embark on new challenges and craft digital solutions that leave a positive impact. </p>
